# Backpropagation Implementation

## Overview

This project is a Python-based implementation of backpropagation, inspired by Andrej Karpathy's instructional video on YouTube. The purpose of this project is to understand and demonstrate how backpropagation works in a simple neural network. The implementation is lightweight and designed for educational purposes, focusing on the fundamental concepts of neural network training.

## Features

- **Manual Backpropagation:** Implements the backpropagation algorithm without relying on deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **Simple Neural Network:** Uses a minimal neural network with a single hidden layer for clarity.
- **Gradient Calculation:** Demonstrates the calculation of gradients for weights and biases.
- **Loss Optimization:** Shows how backpropagation is used to minimize the loss function through gradient descent.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Numpy

You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Files

- `backpropagation.py`: The main script containing the implementation of the neural network and backpropagation algorithm.
- `utils.py`: A utility file for helper functions such as data generation and plotting.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hammad-Aslam/Build-Backward-Propagation-Library
   ```

2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python backpropagation.py
   ```

3. Modify the parameters in the script to experiment with different network configurations, learning rates, and data.

## How It Works

The implementation follows these steps:

1. **Forward Pass:** Compute the output of the neural network by passing the input through the layers.
2. **Loss Calculation:** Calculate the loss using a loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error).
3. **Backward Pass (Backpropagation):** Compute the gradients of the loss concerning each weight and bias using the chain rule.
4. **Gradient Descent:** Update the weights and biases using the computed gradients to minimize the loss.
